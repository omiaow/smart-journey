## RIP my first best project (1 January 2020 - 2 November 2021)! 💐😔
As of 2 November 2021, the Skyscanner API endpoint is no longer available to RapidAPI service (as confirmed via email from RapidAPI team).\
After this experience, I wanna advise for developers to build their lovely app with no any unstable dependencies like shared someone's API.
